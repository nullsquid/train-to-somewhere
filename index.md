# Train To Somewhere
## 200 word RPG, written with Nolan Filter
### ~20 minutes depending on number of players
You are a party of pilgrims making your way, by train, to *The Rock*.
None of you have met before.
You each write down on an index card your reason for visiting *The Rock* 
and what you hope to gain by visiting it.
On the back of the card, you each write down a secret regret your character has. Your
character's goal is to resolve that regret.

The train makes a number of stops as there are players. Starting with the **first player**,
and moving clockwise, each player names the town they arrive in and can choose to have a scene with
another player. After all players have gone, the group has a final scene together at *The Rock*. After the close of the game,
the players discuss if they resolved their regrets and if they gained what they had hoped to by visiting the rock in a brief
Epilogue scene for each character.
