You are a party of pilgrims making your way, by train, to *The Rock*.
None of you have met before.
You each write down on an index card your reason for visiting *The Rock* 
and what you hope to gain by visiting it.
On the back of the card, you each write down a secret regret your character has. Your
character's goal is to resolve that regret.
