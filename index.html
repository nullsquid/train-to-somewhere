    <h1>Train to Somewhere</h1>
    <h2>Play time: 20 minutes
    <p>
      You are a party of pilgrims making your way, by train, to <em>The Rock</em>.
      None of you have met before.
      You each write down on an index card your reason for visiting <em>The Rock</em> 
      and what you hope to gain by visiting it.
      On the back of the card, you each write down a secret regret your character has. Your
      character's goal is to resolve that regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train makes a number of stops as there are players. Starting with the <strong>first player</strong>,
      and moving clockwise, each player names the town they arrive in and can choose to have a scene with
      another player. After all players have gone, the group has a final scene together at <em>The Rock</em>. After the close of the game,
      the players discuss if they resolved their regrets and if they gained what they had hoped to by visiting the rock in a brief
      Epilogue scene for each character.
